# Przygody Pana Cegły

*"The world’s only brick-throwing dad simulator (probably)."*

## The Story

Disaster has struck!
Mr. Brick’s kids have gone missing, scattered across mysterious lands filled with treacherous traps, cranky critters, and more collapsing bridges than an OSHA nightmare.

Armed with nothing but his legs, his wits, and an infinite supply of throwable bricks (don’t ask where he keeps them), Mr. Brick will stop at nothing to bring his children home.

## The Mission

Run, jump, and hurl bricks with pinpoint accuracy as you navigate dangerous worlds. Smash enemies, trigger ancient mechanisms, and uncover hidden treasures, all while dodging hazards that seem designed specifically to ruin your day.
