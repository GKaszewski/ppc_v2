# Przygody Pana CegÅ‚y

*"The worldâ€™s only brick-throwing dad simulator (probably)."*

---

## The Story

Disaster has struck!
Mr. Brickâ€™s kids have gone missing, scattered across mysterious lands filled with treacherous traps, cranky critters, and more collapsing bridges than an OSHA nightmare.

Armed with nothing but his legs, his wits, and an infinite supply of throwable bricks (donâ€™t ask where he keeps them), Mr. Brick will stop at nothing to bring his children home.

---

## The Mission

Run, jump, and hurl bricks with pinpoint accuracy as you navigate dangerous worlds. Smash enemies, trigger ancient mechanisms, and uncover hidden treasures, all while dodging hazards that seem designed specifically to ruin your day.

---

## Features Thatâ€™ll Knock Your Bricks Off

* **Tight, Classic Platforming**
  Leap over pits, time your jumps, and try not to land in something unpleasant.

* **Brick-Fu Combat**
  Toss bricks to flatten foes, flip switches, and solve puzzles in the most dad-like way possible.

* **Secrets & Collectibles**
  Hunt for coins, discover hidden rooms, and find upgrades to make you just a *little* less fragile.

* **NES-Inspired Pixel Art**
  All the charm of an 8-bit classic, no cartridge blowing required.
